<p>Oh, well, hello there, I didn't see you come in. My name is Terence Minerbrook, this is my personal page.<br>  
I am working on learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript and Python and Command Line, BASH stuff on my laptop, which is running on Linux Ubuntu. I am, like many people, am teaching myself to make things, in order to make things.<br>
I am working on a Color Picker, an Image Gallery, a Blog and a To-Do's page. These are ambitious goals. Consider them a work in progress. 
I am watching Andrei Inageoi's  "The Complete Web Developer Zero to Mastery", as well as the " Practical JavaScript - Watch & Code " by Gordon Zhu. I also use CodeAcademy and FreeCodeCamp and Weboas.is.<br>
You will also find that this is the only link to my fiction. I thought it better to formally quarantine one thing from the other.
